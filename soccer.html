			<div id="text"> <p> Soccer is the first ever sport I played when I was young. I would bring a ball almost anywhere we would go as a child just to be able to kick around if I was bored. It used to only be a hobby, but in high school I decided to take it serious and aspire to be the best soccer player that I can be. My favorite team is Liverpool, my favorite player is Lionel Messi (goat), and my favorite soccer  moment is beating the number 1 team in the state as a senior. </p> </div>
