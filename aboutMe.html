			<p> My name is Simbiso Abel Ngoni Chideya. Here in the states, I go by Simbi. I am a 19 year old Zimbabwean-American and I am currently enrolled at Shaw University, where I major in computer science with a concentration in cyber security. In addition to majoring in computer science, I play on the men's soccer team here at Shaw. When I graduate, I hope to have the option to either continue pursuing soccer at the semi-professional or professional level, or enter the work force and obtain a job in the computer science field. Here on this website, you will find my history with my schooling and with soccer, as well as a few of my other hobbies. </p>
