		<p> I love music, and the piano was my first instrument. Since I began playing at age 8, I've studied various genres like contemporary christian, jazz, classical, and contemporary. I also am learning to play the electric guitar, but that admittedly is more challenging. I've played in piano recitlts and Christmas concerts, both of which I miss doing. Below is my personal piano account, where I post covers when I have time.</p>
